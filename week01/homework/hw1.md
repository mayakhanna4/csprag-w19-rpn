{{ My computing experience has aligned more closely with Unix culture as I frequently use the command line for a variety of tasks, to open documents in sublime or atom or to make my computer sleep. I also feel that I would value a command line or text drive core compared to a GUI. }}
```
## Question 3

{{ I found both of these articles very relatable, as I know I have given up on projects because I have gotten too stuck on all the command line bullshittery. These articles bring up the very interesting point that it is important to struggle with this in order to develop coding meta cognition and therefore become a better developer. It has encouraged me to allow myself to struggle with the command line in order to be able to improve my problem solving skills.}}
