## Question 1
``` 1
There was no make because we changed the header file, and not the cpp file of the program so there was no re-make. This is a problem because if you change something in the header it will not be accurately rebuilded.
```

## Question 2
``` 2
 g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -O2 \
	      simple_test.cpp p2.cpp Recursive_list.cpp Binary_tree.cpp p2.h \
	      recursive.cpp test_helpers.cpp -o simple_test
```

## Question 3

	Use --always-make because it will unconditionally build the clean target
```

## Question 4
``` 4
	Add .PHONY: clean
```
